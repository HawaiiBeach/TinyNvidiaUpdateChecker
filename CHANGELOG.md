All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) 
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]
### Fixed
- Reverted DPI scaling changes

## [1.26.1] - 2026-09-07
### Added
- Custom error message for when client update failed due to missing write permissions

### Fixed
- DPI inconsistencies caused "New driver form" to be zoomed in
- "Delete temp files" would delete the full download folder, deleting potential none-TNUC related files. Now it only deletes relevant files, and only deletes the folder if it's empty

### Changed
- Hide local source path in error messages (C:\Users\Samuel\....)

## [1.26.0] - 2026-08-11
This update focuses on community feedback from Discord. Make sure to join and let me know what you think about the new features, and if you have any (good) suggestions.

### Added
- New ready install UI, which allows you to browse driver folder, start installer, and delete temporary files
- New command line argument `--driver-path=<optional>`, [read more in the Wiki entry](https://github.com/HawaiiBeach/TinyNvidiaUpdateChecker/wiki/Command-Line-Arguments)

### Changed
- Configuration file is now stored in `%localappdata%\TinyNvidiaUpdateChecker\` instead of `%localappdata%\Hawaii_Beach\TinyNvidiaUpdateChecker\`. It auto migrates the old config file to the new location, and deletes the old config
- Minimal installer no longer uses the latest choosen components saved in config, instead shows the dialog every time (except quiet mode), and a new button has been added "Last used"

### Fixed
- Hotfix for navigate to GitHub prompt causing exception

## [1.16.0] - 2023-01-21
This update migrated from the discontinued .NET Framework to .NET 7. TNUC will from this point forward require the .NET 7 Desktop Runtime x86. Windows versions below 10 are not supported by it. There might also be new bugs with this move so please report them if you find any. Thanks to .NET single file publish the false positive trojan is no longer an issue.

### Added
- `--config-override=<path>` command line argument. `<path>` is absolute file path
- Support for local GPU metadata files `gpu-data.json` and `os-data.json`. They must be in the working directory, and used in special cases where GitHub is a blocked domain
- Added Scoop environment variable to list for possible 7-Zip installations, see #97

### Changed
- Migrated from discontinued .NET Framework to .NET 7. TNUC will from this point forward require the .NET 7 Desktop Runtime x86
- Improved error handling for NVIDIA API and metadata repo
- Improved library detection code
- Remove unwanted image tags and URLs from release description

## [1.15.4] - 2022-12-27
Happy new years everyone. Here is another minor update that wont change much for most people
### Fixed
- Some GPUs such as 970M download URLs begin with HTTP and not HTTPS which broke the code. See issue #139

### Changed
- Update regex to filter "COLLECTORS EDITION" GPUs. See issue #140

## [1.15.3] - 2022-12-15
Merry Christmas! Here is a early gift from me.
### Added
- DCH driver migration, if user currently has non-DCH drivers and operating system supports it. They were discontinued after version 472.12

### Fixed
- Adjustment to GPU name to match metadata in nvidia-data repo for `Super` GPU variants

## [1.15.2] - 2022-11-26
### Fixed
- Some notebooks recognized as desktop

## [1.15.1] - 2022-11-20
### Fixed
- GPU metadata not found on GPUs with "Max-Q" in name, and "Super" GPU variants

### Changed
- Reimplemented proper way of getting release PDF. If not found then the button will be greyed out

## [1.15.0] - 2022-11-19
### Changed
- Now querying NVIDIA API to properly get the latest GPU driver for your card. Much lower risk of code stopping to work if they change their website, URL format or whatever. Thanks to [ZenitH-AT](https://github.com/ZenitH-AT/) for his NVIDIA research and data repo. This new query code is based of his [nvidia-update](https://github.com/ZenitH-AT/nvidia-update) project. This also means that most GPUs are now supported. Still need to write code to get driver for GPUs that don't have a driver installed and named generic in device manager
- Minor code cleanup
- No more DLLs needed with the executable, as they are now embedded

### Removed
- Ditched HAP as it's no longer needed. DLLs will be packaged in the EXE for the future (such as JSON package)
- `--ignore-missing-gpu` command line argument. A replacement is coming in the future, it was removed because the old implementation would download drivers for GTX 970 (hardcoded). Replacement code coming soon

## [1.14.7] - 2022-11-06
### Fixed
- NVIDIA changed their website code, breaking TNUC. I've fixed it for now but a complete rewrite is needed to use their API... See issue #114

### Changed
- Bumped to .NET Framework 4.8

## [1.14.6] - 2022-06-26
### Fixed
- Non-DCH drivers are no longer supported by NVIDIA. So they are always opted to be installed. See issue #101

### Changed
- Merged duplicate code, and improved driver download code (more improvements are needed)
- Updated HAP to 1.11.43

## [1.14.5] - 2021-09-06
### Added
- DCH driver support

## [1.14.4] - 2021-09-04
### Added
- Missing "Press any key to exit" where applicable

### Fixed
- HAP being verified and downloaded to the current directory, and not the TNUC binary directory
- Nvidia URL response was not the latest driver version

## [1.14.3] - 2021-06-23
### Fixed
- Fixed a wrong assumption in the driver version fetch code. The code now reads it from right to left as it's always five digits (right?)

## [1.14.2] - 2020-08-18
### Fixed
- Nvidia made a minor URL adjustment on their website

### Changed
- Driver downloads are now being done with HTTPS protocol

## [1.14.1] - 2020-05-15
### Fixed
- Not launching extracted drivers when using minimal installer

## [1.14.0] - 2020-05-15
I am back, sorry for being inactive the past years. I've been very busy with GTA related projects for years until recently where I got dropped out, and now focusing on my own side projects. I hope you all enjoy this new version!
### Added
- Download selection form, you can now select the download server. Hopefully this resolves issues with slow downloads
- Compare HAP versions, making sure downloaded one is the correct one (which also prevents further errors)
- We now run the NVIDIA installer with the `/noreboot` if the application is running quiet to prevent random reboots
- Support for DCH drivers thanks to [Osspial](https://github.com/Osspial)

- Driver installer no longer hardcoded to run quiet if minimal installer is used
- Replaced `/noeula` argument with `/nosplash` argument when minimal installer isn't used, which caused Gf Experience to install

## [1.13.0] - 2018-06-06
### Added
- QuickEdit is now disabled, no more accidentally stalling the application

### Changed
- Minor message when hash doesn't match
- Updated HAP to v1.8.4

### Fixed
- Minimal installer not extracting new required EULA files [#41](https://github.com/HawaiiBeach/TinyNvidiaUpdateChecker/issues/41) - thanks [cywq](https://github.com/cywq)

## [1.12.0] - 2018-03-09
### Added
- Implemented checks for the MD5 hash for the HAP dll file. This is to make so that people don't use a wrong version of HAP, since TNUC only previously checkes for the file name. Now we are also checking the hash which means that we are comparing the entire file. This should fix all the dll hell trouble, sorry for the late fix :/

### Changed
- Moved class files
- Updated HAP to v1.7.1

### Fixed
- An issue where the file is still being used by TNUC after the drivers have been downloaded. This was the cause of [#26](https://github.com/HawaiiBeach/TinyNvidiaUpdateChecker/issues/26), thanks a lot [indivisible](https://github.com/indivisible) for fixing the issue, credits to him!

- Support for alternative locations for 7-Zip (Scoop, x86 install on amd64 systems, MSI installer and last resort)
- Check against vendor ID if the gpu drivers aren't installed
- Missing text

### Fixed
- Driver installer always run quietly, now only skipping eula
- Tiny text on none dpi-displays in the driver dialog

## [1.9.0] - 2017-09-25
### Added
- New fancy dialog when a new driver is available, with a much better GUI solution and better release notes preview
- Support for 7-Zip, and an improved library handling system
- `--confirm-dl` argument. It will automaticly download and install new drivers! (uses minimal installer)
- `--config-here` argument. It uses the working directory as the path for the config
- Implemented check for driver file size

- CTRL+C inputs are now ignored.

### Fixed
- Fixed a issue related to using the `--quiet` command argument to run a silent window.

## [1.4.0] - 2016-10-12
Long time no see, or that's what they say at least. I have been busy being a typical student, I am trying to keep up dev but only have so much spare time to spare programming. As you see, the versions have been spaced a lot. I haven't made the same amount of changes in the code either lately as I used to do (when I had a lot of free time), but that doesn't mean that I am abandoning this project.

Might start pushing out beta versions if people are interested in that kind of stuff, thing is that I am really wondering if people are even using this application, so it might be for... nothing. And in that case, wouldn't this entire project be for nothing..? I don't have a clue of the userbase.

Whatever, a new version out lads.
### Added
- Added the argument `--force-dl` for a force download of gpu drivers even if the drivers are up-to-date.
- Option to view release PDF.

### Changed
- Command line argument handler has been improved, and the argument for erasing local config file has been changed to `--erase-config`.
- Some code has been moved around.
- The default download folder is now the users Downloads folder instead of the temp folder.

### Added
- Instead of just launching web browser where user has to load the NVIDA website in order to download the driver, the application now does it for you. Using SaveFileDialog to choose GPU driver save file.
- Basic documentation started.

### Changed
- Changes around config system, for example the key `Desktop GPU` has been renamed to `GPU Type`.
- Code 10% more bullet proof.
- Updated HTMLAgilityPack to v1.4.9.5, and therefore upped .NET framework target to 4.5.
- All released builds are now set to the "Release" build type in VS for better performance.

### Fixed
- Repairing a config key does no longer skip the request.

## [1.2.0] - 2016-07-10
### Added
- Missing author in assembly information.
- Support for mobile NVIDIA GPUs.
- New argument - `--eraseConfig`, erases configuration file.

### Changed
- Minor cleanup and improvements.
- Complete re-write of config system, had a great time doing so and had to be done - old system was wanky. Moved to `.xml` format powered by the .NET framework.
