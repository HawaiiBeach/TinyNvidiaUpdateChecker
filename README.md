## Main features

### Lightweight, portable and fully open-sourced

Alternatives are either bloated, or not open-sourced, or both. They are a security vulnerability waiting to happen.

Or they require you to install them, and cannot be run in portable mode - leaving a lot of trash files in your PC.

Some even require admin permissions to run (!!).

### Debloats the driver install
